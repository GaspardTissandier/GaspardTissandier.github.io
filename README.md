# Working paper :

I am actually in the last year of my Ph.D., and my dissertation covers the application of machine learning in Public Policy. My work is dedicated to identifying how machine learning pertains to Public Policy, how we can apprehend and make the best of these methods, and how we can use economics theory to regulate machine learning applications in the public sector. My fields of application are economics of education and economics of criminality. 

### Heterogeneous effects of dropout on labor market outcomes : the French higher education case : 

For higher education system with different tracks, the question of how to allow resources between tracks for dropout policy is fundamental, as in France the university concentrate most of the focus and resources compared to the other technical track. This paper questions this setting by estimating heterogeneous effect of dropping out on labor market outcomes (rate of employment and wages) conditional on the tracks and other socio-demographic characteristics
of students. I use the GRF algorithm with the distance to the closest higher education institution at 6th grade as an instrument to estimate the effect of dropping out. I find that using 2SLS lead to underestimate the overall effect of dropping by 9 percentage points for the rate of employment, and by 4 percentage points for the average wage. Technical track dropouts are actually more penalized than university dropout on the average wage, but not on the time in employment.

### PAVED with good intentions : an evaluation of the Gendarmerie predictive policing system (joint work with Yann Lecorps) 

In this paper, we study the efficiency and displacement effect of a predictive policing algorithm used by the Gendarmerie (a law enforcement authority in France). We use a adapted Two-Way Fixed Effect model and an Open Data criminal database to assess the potential reduction in criminality induced by the use of this algorithm. The, the potential deterrence or displacement effect is measured in neighboring area to understand the diffusion of criminality on a geographic scale.

# Work in progress :

### Social segregation in secondary education based on income brackets (joint work with Pr. Pierre Courtioux and Pr. Tristan-Pierre Maury)

In this paper, we input income brackets on the administrative secondary education students database using a bootstrapping methodology by using external income and living condition databases. Using this framework, we compute different segregation indexes and study their evolution through time. 

### An application of predictive enforcement (co-authored with Cesar Barilla & Yeon-Koo Che, Columbia University)

Using the NYPD granular data on oﬀenses, we replicate a predictive policing algorithm to predict criminality in real-time on a precise geographical scale in New York City. We apply the Predpol algorithm and develop an algorithm of our own for this aim. Using this setting, we test the hypothesis of "dataﬁcation" in the context of predictive policing. Following a multi-armed bandit setting, in case of law enforcement lead by predictive algorithm, the endogenous data generation will lead to sub-optimal dispatching of units across neighborhood, putting to much weight on exploitation and not enough on exploration.

# Non academic communications :

With the Twitter Explorer project team from the DHAI Intensive week we build a twitter interaction network about the users who took part of the discussion about the french presidential debate. You can find a blog note about our work [here](https://blog.twitterexplorer.org/post/debatmacronlepen/)

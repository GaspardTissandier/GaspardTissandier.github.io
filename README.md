### Heterogeneous effects of dropout on labor market outcomes : the French higher education case : 

In this paper, I ask if the higher education policy implemented in France in 2007 target the right type of first years students. I study the effect of dropping out on labor market outcomes (time in employment and wage) for new entrants in the labor market. I use a french database of students who ended their study in 2010, and are observed until 2013. The focus of this paper is the heterogeneity of the dropout effect, especially how various personal characteristics such as gender, social origin or academic path can shape this effect.

### PAVED with good intentions : an evaluation of the Gendarmerie predictive policing system (co-authored with Yann Lecorps) 

In this paper, we study the efficiency and displacement effect of a predictive policing algorithm used by the Gendarmerie (a law enforcement authority in France). We use a adapted Two-Way Fixed Effect model and an Open Data criminal database to assess the potential reduction in criminality induced by the use of this algorithm. The, the potential deterrence or displacement effect is measured in neighboring area to understand the diffusion of criminality on a geographic scale. 

### Chosing between AI or Expert : a drift diffusion model approach

This paper addresses the problem of a constrained social planner having to choose between an algorithm and a human expert to execute classification. The social planner have to chose between the both after a certain period of time, and based on a noised efficiency/accuracy measure. I apply a drift diffusion model to this problem, and study the dynamic of resource allocation between these systems.

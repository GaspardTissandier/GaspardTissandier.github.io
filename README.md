## Heterogeneous effects of dropout on labor market outcomes : the French higher education case : 

In this paper, I study the effect of dropping out on labor market outcomes for new entrants in the labor market. I use a french database of students who ended their study in 2010, and are observed until 2013. The focus of this paper is the heterogeneity of the dropout effect, especially how various personal characteristics such as gender, social origin or academic path can shape this effect.
